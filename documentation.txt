sqlForPartialUpdate is used to update sql for companies and users fully or partially.
The function is declared inside of helpers.js and stored as a method (update) on both the User and Company models. 
update is invoked via a patch req to /users/:username or /companies/:handle
For both the company and user route, access to update functionality is restriced to logged in users. 
The update function accepts 2 parameters, the new data and the handle or username of the row being update.
The handle/username comes from a URL parameter while the data is obtained from the JSON in the req body.
When the update func is invoked, it invokes sqlForPartialUpdate, passing in the data and the columns to be altered as parameters. 
inside sqlForPartialUpdate the data is turned into into an array of keys which is then iterated through
to convert each element into an SQL statement. {firstName: 'Aliya', age: 32} => ['"first_name"=$1', '"age"=$2']. 
That array is then converted to a string with each former element separated by a comma. That, along with an array of the passed in values is returned by the function.
